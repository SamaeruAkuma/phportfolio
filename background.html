		</div>
		<p>For quite some time in my early teenage years, I worked quite a bit with C#, mainly to program my own games in the Unity Engine. Which, with the help of tutorials and no small amount of trial and error I was able to make my own, basic, game.</p>
		<h2>Java</h2>
		<div>
			<img id="java" src="images/java.png">
		</div>
		<p>I started programming in Java, during my final year of High School, and took a years worth of it during my time in USCB. Outside of eduction, I have made a few simple programs in order to still keep the language somewhat fresh in my mind.</p>
		<h2>HTML and CSS</h2>

		<p>For the better part of a year, I've been coding in HTML and CSS, mainly to contribute as co-creator of a site for Japanese learning I am making with my brother. And currently, taking a class involving the very subject, at USCB.</p>
		<h2>JS</h2>
		<div>
			<img id="js" src="images/jslogo.png">
		</div>
		<p>Furthermore, being into web-development as I have been, I know a little amount of JS in order to contribute to the Japanese learning site. And, just laughs, made a site entirely in JS.</p>
		<p></p>
		<h2>Python</h2>
		<div>
			<img id="python" src="images/pythonlogo.png">
		</div>
		<p>Python was one of the first langauges that I learned to program in, aside from C#. Overtime, I took a small hiatus from the language in pursuit of other endeavors. And now, currently, I know enough Python to operate flask applications for websites.</p>
		<h2>SQL and Postegres</h2>
		<div>
			<img id="sql" src="images/sql.png">
		</div>
		<p>For about two semesters at USCB, I learned the SQL database language, and a small amount of ASP.NET (a C# framework) in order to tie a SQL database to a website. Outside of school, I've used PostegresSQL to still make sure the langauge, and its basics, stay fresh in my mind.</p>
