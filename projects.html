    	<h2>Past Projects</h2>
    	
    	<h3>Database Management</h3>
    	<p>As a part of the course, I had to create a Sql database using Microsoft SQL server. In the later course, which was a sort of sequel to the first, focused on using ASP.NET in order to tie a SQL database to a functioning website. Also, from that experience, I can easily query data within any given SQL database.</p>
    	
    	<h3>Systems and Server Adminstration</h3>
    	<p>At USCB, I've learned to utilize AWS (Amazon Web Service) in order to create a Linux and Windows server. During that time, I learned the basic of server administration and how to run a server in a company setting.</p>
    	
    	<h3>Java Programming and Game-Development</h3>
    	<p>In my first year at USCB, I used the Java programming language, in tangent with the Greenfoot engine in order to make a small game with the compiled language. </p>
    	
    	<h2>Current</h2>
    	
    	<h3>Web Development</h3>
    	<p>Currently, I'm co-creator and develope of a site dedicated to the pursuit of Japanese Learning. Although, me and my partner/brother, Tallen Thompson, have had some hiccups in development, and currently re-working the site as now, we soon seek to publish Nihongo.net to a public interested in the learning Japanese language.</p>
    	
    	<h2>Future</h2>
    	
    	<h3>Horror Game</h3>
    	<p>Something that's pure concept by now, is me and partner's plans to make a horror/puzzle game using the Unity engine.</p>
